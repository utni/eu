# The Action for Annulment: Article 263 TFEU

A Cornerstone of the European Union's System of Judicial Review

---

## Introduction: The EU as a "Community Based on the Rule of Law"

* **Core Principle:** The EU is founded on the rule of law. Neither Member States nor institutions can escape judicial review.

  * **Source:** *Parti écologiste ‘Les Verts’ v European Parliament* (Case 294/83).

* **Article 19(1) TEU:** Entrusts the CJEU to ensure "in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed."

* **Article 263 TFEU:** The primary and most direct tool for judicial review of EU acts.

---

## The Central Tension

A fundamental conflict between:

1. **The Promise:** A comprehensive system of judicial review for all.

2. **The Reality:** Highly restrictive access (*locus standi*) for individuals (natural and legal persons).

This reflects the EU's decentralized judicial system, balancing direct review (Art. 263) with the role of national courts (Art. 267).

---

## Part 1: What is a 'Reviewable Act'?

* **Art. 263(1) TFEU:** The Court reviews the legality of:

  * Legislative acts.

  * Acts of the Council, Commission, and ECB (other than recommendations/opinions).

  * Acts of the European Parliament and European Council *intended to produce legal effects*.

  * Acts of EU bodies, offices, or agencies *intended to produce legal effects*.

---

## The "Substance Over Form" Doctrine

* **Key Principle:** The Court looks at the *effect* of an act, not its name or form.

* **Landmark Case:** *Commission v Council (ERTA)* (Case 22/70).

* **Test:** Does the act "produce legal effects" or bring about a "distinct change in the legal position"?

* **Result:** Allows the Court to review *sui generis* acts like Council deliberations, conclusions, etc., if they are binding.

---

## The Contested Frontier: "Soft Law"

* **What is it?** Non-binding instruments like communications, guidelines, and notices.

* **The Problem:** These acts can have profound *practical* effects but are formally non-binding.

* **The Rule:** Art. 263(1) explicitly excludes "recommendations and opinions."

* **Court's Position:** Generally holds that soft law is non-reviewable because it lacks *legally binding effects*.

* **Dilemma:** This creates a potential gap in judicial protection.

---

## Part 2: Who Can Bring an Action? (*Locus Standi*)

Article 263 establishes a clear hierarchy of applicants:

1. **Privileged Applicants**

2. **Semi-Privileged Applicants**

3. **Non-Privileged Applicants**

---

## Privileged Applicants (Art. 263(2))

* **Who:** Member States, European Parliament, Council, and Commission.

* **Standing:** Absolute and unconditional.

* **Rationale:** They act "in the interests of legality" as guardians of the Treaties. They do not need to prove any specific interest in the case.

---

## Semi-Privileged Applicants (Art. 263(3))

* **Who:** Court of Auditors, European Central Bank (ECB), and Committee of the Regions.

* **Standing:** Conditional.

* **Test:** They can only bring an action "for the purpose of protecting their prerogatives." They must show the act infringes on their specific powers.

---

## Non-Privileged Applicants (Art. 263(4))

* **Who:** Natural and legal persons (individuals, companies, NGOs).

* **This is the most complex and restrictive area.**

* The Treaty provides three distinct gateways for standing.

---

## Gateway 1: Act Addressed to the Applicant

* **Test:** The individual is the *direct addressee* of the act.

* **Example:** A Commission decision imposing a competition fine on a specific company.

* **Standing:** Automatic and straightforward.

---

## Gateway 2: The Classic Test

* **Used for:** Acts *not* addressed to the applicant (e.g., a regulation or a decision addressed to a Member State).

* **The Test:** The applicant must prove **TWO** cumulative conditions:

  1. **Direct Concern**

  2. **Individual Concern**

---

## Classic Test: (1) Direct Concern

* The act must *directly affect* the applicant's legal situation.

* It must leave *no discretion* to the implementing authority (e.g., a Member State).

* If a Member State has any genuine discretion in applying the act, the test for direct concern fails.

---

## Classic Test: (2) Individual Concern

* This is the most formidable obstacle in EU law.

* **The *Plaumann* Test** (Case 25/62 *Plaumann v Commission*):

  > "...affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons..."

* **In Practice:** The applicant must belong to a "fixed, closed class" of persons identifiable *at the moment the act was adopted*.

* Being part of an "open class" (like "all current and future importers of clementines") is not enough.

---

## Gateway 3: The Lisbon Reform

* A third limb was added to Art. 263(4) to *supposedly* relax the *Plaumann* test.

* **The New Test:** An individual can challenge a **"regulatory act"** which is of:

  1. **Direct Concern** to them

  2. **AND** "does not entail implementing measures."

* **Key change:** The "individual concern" (*Plaumann*) test is removed for this specific category.

---

## Lisbon Reform Curtailed (1/2)

The CJEU's interpretation has severely limited the reform's impact.

* **What is a "Regulatory Act"?**

* **Case:** *Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami* (C-583/11 P).

* **Ruling:** A 'regulatory act' is any act of general application *except for legislative acts*.

* **Impact:** All acts adopted via the ordinary or special legislative procedure (i.e., most major regulations and directives) are **EXCLUDED** from this new, easier test.

* To challenge a *legislative act*, you must still use the *Plaumann* test.

---

## Lisbon Reform Curtailed (2/2)

* **What does "does not entail implementing measures" mean?**

* **Case:** *Telefónica v Commission* (C-274/12 P).

* **Ruling:** Any subsequent act required for execution, even a "mere check" or a national act to recover state aid, is an "implementing measure."

* **Impact:** This closes the door on the new test in almost all cases where a Member State is involved.

* **Result:** The Lisbon reform has been largely neutralized by the Court. The *Plaumann* test remains dominant.

---

## Part 3: The Grounds for Annulment

If standing is established, the action must be based on one of four grounds (Art. 263(2)):

1. **Lack of competence**

2. **Infringement of an essential procedural requirement**

3. **Infringement of the Treaties or any rule of law**

4. **Misuse of powers**

---

## Grounds 1 & 2: Procedural and Competence

* **1. Lack of Competence:** The EU institution acted *ultra vires* (beyond its powers).

  * Violates the principle of conferral (Art. 5 TEU).

* **2. Infringement of an Essential Procedural Requirement:** The correct decision-making process was not followed.

  * **Example:** Failure to consult the European Parliament when required (*Isoglucose* cases).

  * **Example:** Failure to provide a proper statement of reasons (Art. 296 TFEU).

* The Court will raise these two grounds *of its own motion*.

---

## Ground 3: Infringement of the Treaties / Rule of Law

* The broadest and most common "catch-all" ground.

* Covers any substantive violation of EU law, including:

  * The **Treaties** (TEU, TFEU).

  * The **Charter of Fundamental Rights**.

  * **General Principles of EU Law** (proportionality, legal certainty, legitimate expectations, non-discrimination).

* This is the primary vehicle for the CJEU's constitutional review.

---

## Ground 4: Misuse of Powers

* **Original name:** *Détournement de pouvoir*.

* **Definition:** The institution used its powers for a purpose *other than* the one for which they were granted.

* **Challenges:**

  * It concerns the *subjective motive* of the institution.

  * It is extremely difficult to prove.

* This ground is very rarely successful.

---

## Part 4: The Effects of Annulment (Art. 264 & 266)

* **If the action succeeds, the act is declared "void" (Art. 264).**

* **Effect 1: *Ex Tunc***

  * The annulment is retroactive. The act is considered to have *never existed*.

* **Effect 2: *Erga Omnes***

  * The judgment is binding on *everyone*, not just the parties to the case.

---

## Effects: The Court's Discretion

* **The Problem:** Retroactive annulment can create a legal vacuum and chaos, upsetting legal certainty.

* **The Solution: Art. 264(2) TFEU**

  * The Court can "state which of the effects of the act... shall be considered as definitive."

* **In Practice:** The Court can maintain the effects of the annulled act (making the annulment *ex nunc* - from this point forward) until a new, legal act is adopted.

* This balances the **Rule of Law** with **Legal Certaınty**.

---

## Effects: The Obligation to Comply (Art. 266)

* The institution whose act was annulled "shall be required to take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment."

* This means they must act to fill the legal void, for example, by adopting a new, corrected act that respects the Court's reasoning.

---

## Conclusion: The "Complete System of Legal Remedies"

* The CJEU defends restrictive standing rules by pointing to a "complete system" of judicial review.

* This system is a *balance* between two main routes:

  1. **Direct Action (Art. 263):** For privileged applicants and, in rare cases, individuals.

  2. **Indirect Action (Art. 267):** The preliminary ruling procedure.

---

## The Preferred Path: Article 267 TFEU

* When an individual is affected by an EU act that requires national implementation:

  1. They must challenge the *national implementing measure* in their *national court*.

  2. The national court can (or must) then ask the CJEU to rule on the validity of the underlying EU act via a **preliminary reference (Art. 267)**.

* This is the CJEU's preferred route, as it fosters judicial dialogue and preserves the federal structure.

---

## Final Analysis

* **For Institutions:** Art. 263 is a powerful tool to police the institutional balance and legality of EU acts.

* **For Individuals:** The "complete system" is more of an *institutional* guarantee than a practical one.

* The path to justice for an individual is often:

  * Indirect (via national courts).

  * Costly and time-consuming.

  * Uncertain (depends on the national judge making a reference).

* The system prioritizes the **uniformity of EU law** and **judicial federalism** over simple, direct access for its citizens.

---

## Key Case Law Summary

* ***Les Verts***** (1986):** Established the EU as a "Community based on the rule of law."

* ***ERTA***** (1971):** Created the "substance over form" doctrine for reviewable acts.

* ***Plaumann***** (1963):** Established the strict "individual concern" test.

* ***Inuit***** (2013):** Narrowly defined "regulatory act," excluding all legislative acts from the easier Lisbon test.

* ***Telefónica***** (2013):** Narrowly defined "does not entail implementing measures," further limiting the Lisbon test.
